**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 6 steps. 
 1) I converted the images to grayscale
 2) I did a Gaussian Blur to cancel some noise
 3) I used the Canny method to detect edges in our image
 4) I masked the unimportant parts of the image by selecting a portion of our image
 5) I used Hough line transformation to detect the needed lines (road)
 6) Merged our Hough line image with original to see the road on the original image



In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
